{'name': 'Advanced Reconcile Transaction Ref',
 'description':  """
Advanced reconciliation method for the module account_advanced_reconcile
========================================================================
Reconcile rules with bvr_ref of invoice.

It finds a matching invoice for the move_line and reconciles only if the amount of the payment corresponds or if it is a multiple
of the invoice amount. If many invoices are found, the first reconciled invoice is the current invoice (last invoice that is not in future).
Then it reconciles the other invoices from last invoice to first.
