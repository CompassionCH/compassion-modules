Module to track the sponsorship departures and SUB sponsorships.

It is based on a new state : `sds_state`.

It adds a new kanban, tree and form view to track sponsorships after child departure.

Color conventions for SDS Tracking Kanban View :

0 - Blank - Default color

1 - Black - Sponsorships with NO SUB (cancelled, or no_sub)

2 - Red - Sub_rejected sponsorships or sponsorships that are likely to become sub_reject.

3 - Yellow - Indicates a higher priority action is required on this sponsorship.

4 - Light green - Indicates an action is required on this sponsorship, typically a mailing is to be sent to the sponsor. This is a low priority action.

5 - Green - Sub_accepted sponsorships or sponsorships likely to become sub_accept.

6 - Light blue - not used

7 - Blue - Draft sponsorships

8 - Violet - not used
