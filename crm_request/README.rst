This module helps Compassion CH to manage the request of supporter, by updating the module *crm_claim* by OCA.
It uses the *partner_auto_match* module to automatically match incoming emails to existing partners and adds tools
for easily replying to the partners with predefined e-mail templates.

Features:
    #. Detect incoming email address and assign to existing partner.
    #. Read and keep the Reply-To field, for answering to the desired email address.
    #. Custom automatic replies during holidays.
    #. Automatic claim category assignment based on keywords found in the subject.
    #. Automatic reply if a customer updates a request on which the assigned employee is on leave.
    #. Periodic reminders to users about open requests.
