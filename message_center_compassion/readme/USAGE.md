Once configured, the Compassion Connect module will handle the following:

- **Sending Messages**: Automatically queues and sends messages to Compassion International. GMC Managers can view and manage the outgoing message queue through the `Message Center` menu. They can also manually trigger the sending of queued messages if needed.
- **Receiving Messages**: Listens for incoming messages from Compassion International and processes them accordingly. GMC Managers can monitor incoming messages in real-time through the `Incoming Messages` view, where they can see the status and details of each message.
- **Message Management**: Provides an interface for viewing and managing the message queues. GMC Managers have access to the `Message Queue` dashboard, which displays both incoming and outgoing messages. They can filter, search, and sort messages based on various criteria. Additionally, they can retry failed messages, delete unnecessary ones, and view detailed logs for troubleshooting.

This module ensures that your Odoo system stays in sync with Compassion International, facilitating smooth and efficient communication.
