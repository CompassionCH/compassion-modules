Configuration
=============

To configure this module, follow these steps:

1. **Odoo Configuration**:

   -  Add the following settings in the ``.conf`` file of Odoo:

      -  ``connect_url``: URL to the entry point of GMC Onramp
      -  ``connect_token_server``: Base URL of the token server
      -  ``connect_token_cert``: Comma-separated list of full URLs of
         the public keys of the token server

2. **Odoo Settings**:

   -  Navigate to
      ``Settings -> General Settings -> Compassion -> Message Center``
      and set the following:

      -  ``connect_gpid``: Your GPA ID for using GMC message services
      -  ``connect_gp_name``: Your GPA name for using GMC message
         services
      -  ``connect_api_key``: API key for using GMC message services
      -  ``connect_client``: Username for token requests
      -  ``connect_secret``: Password for token requests

3. **User Setup**:

   -  Create a user with the required access rights and set the login
      credentials to match those sent by GMC in tokens.
   -  Assign the "GMC Manager" access rights to users responsible for
      managing messages.

Usage
=====

Once configured, the Compassion Connect module will handle the
following:

-  **Sending Messages**: Automatically queues and sends messages to
   Compassion International. GMC Managers can view and manage the
   outgoing message queue through the ``Message Center`` menu. They can
   also manually trigger the sending of queued messages if needed.
-  **Receiving Messages**: Listens for incoming messages from Compassion
   International and processes them accordingly. GMC Managers can
   monitor incoming messages in real-time through the
   ``Incoming Messages`` view, where they can see the status and details
   of each message.
-  **Message Management**: Provides an interface for viewing and
   managing the message queues. GMC Managers have access to the
   ``Message Queue`` dashboard, which displays both incoming and
   outgoing messages. They can filter, search, and sort messages based
   on various criteria. Additionally, they can retry failed messages,
   delete unnecessary ones, and view detailed logs for troubleshooting.

This module ensures that your Odoo system stays in sync with Compassion
International, facilitating smooth and efficient communication.
