This module helps Compassion CH to manage its planned events, by
creating a new model for tracking upcoming events.

   -  Opportunities can generate new events
   -  Each event is linked to an analytic account
   -  Each event creates a sponsorship origin
   -  Portal users have an analytic account to track sponsorships gained
      by them
   -  Can set ambassadors to sponsorships in order to track who brought
      them

   | Warning: This module deactivates e-mail notification for calendar
     events !
   | If you want to enable it again, please remove the config_parameter
     'calendar.block_mail'.

Interaction Resume
------------------

New partner view to collect all history of communications with a partner
and display them all at the same place.

Demand Planning
---------------

This module contains also the Demand Planning for the GMC Global
Childpool. It is useful to predict the number of children that will be
needed and also to review the past to watch the results and analyze the
predictions that were made.

Here is how the computations are done :

Demand
~~~~~~

   -  Children for the website : each week a fixed number of children
      are requested for the website. This number is taken from the
      Settings (Settings -> Demand Planning)
   -  Children for ambassadors : each week a fixed number of children
      are requested for ambassadors. This number is taken from the
      Settings
   -  Children for SUB Sponsorships : This is a computed number based on
      statistics since one year. It takes the average number of
      registered SUB sponsorships per week and puts that number in all
      weeks of previsions
   -  Children for the Events : This number is directly extracted from
      the planned events, with the "number_allocate_children" number and
      "hold_start_date" set on each event. The number of requested
      children is split evenly between the weeks separating the
      "hold_start_date" and the "event_start_date".

Resupply
~~~~~~~~

   -  Web resupply : Substracts the average of registered sponsorships
      from the web since one year from the number requested (taken from
      the Settings)
   -  Ambassador resupply : Computed like the web, but with the
      ambassador numbers
   -  SUB Sponsorship resupply : Rejected SUB Sponsorships are those
      that were ended in 90 days following the sponsorship creation.
      Resupply is the average of sub rejections we had in the previous
      year.
   -  Events Resupply : The number is extracted from the events and is
      equal to the "number_allocate_children" - "planned_sponsorships"
   -  Sponsorships Cancellations : Cancellations are as well children
      that will be released to the Global Childpool. This number is also
      the average of cancellations from last year.

Weekly Revisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Revisions numbers are computed based on the actual holds that were
created in the revision period, as well as the sponsorships made.
