===========================
HR (Extra) Hours Management
===========================

This module extends the functionality of hr_attendance and allows to keep track of the
work hours of the employees, gives better overview of the work hours and follow the extra hours balance.

You can set in the schedule of the employee how much time they are supposed to work on a daily basis, allow
a maximum extra hours limit, and add minimum break time required. You will better keep track of the extra hours balance
of the employees given all the rules that you setup.

With this module, logging your hours is made easy in Odoo!

Installation
============

Nothing to do.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, go in **Attendances/Configuration/Attendance Settings**:

#. You can configure a *free break* time that is offered to employees. It means this time will count as a break time
   but won't be deduced from the attendance of the employees.
#. You can configure a *maximum extra hours limit*. When the employee makes more extra hours than the limit,
   it doesn't increase anymore his extra hours balance.
#. In **Attendances/Configuration/Break rules**  you can define a minimum break time required per day based on how many
   hours the employee worked on the day.
   Total break is the total break time the employee must do per day
   Minimum break is the minimum time required for at least one break (for instance if the employee should take at least
   30 minutes of break for lunch)
#. In **Attendances/Configuration/Coefficient** you can define special days that will give more extra hours to the
   employee. For instance you could set the Sunday to count 1.5x time. You can limit those rules to specific categories
   of employees.
#. In **Attendances/Manage Attendances/Employee** you can setup the *initial balance* of each employee,
   when you start using the module to count the hours.
   Just go in one employee, under the Hours tab, and set the value. The value will be updated each year to avoid
   computing over more than one year of attendances.
#. In **Employee/Contracts/Working Schedule** configure the working schedule of each employee by going to the
   *resource.calendar* object
#. In **Leaves/Configuration/Leave Types** configure if leave types should not deduce from the due hours of
   the employees by setting *Keep due hours*

To configure the cron which updates the balance of employees annually, go in **Settings/Technical/Automation/Automated Actions**:

#. In the cron *Compute annual extra hours balance* choose the scheduled date on which you want to apply the process to move the extra hours of employees in their annual balance. This is typically done at the beggining of the year.
   This process avoids the system to compute a huge amount of data after a few years of attendance.

#. An second cron *Update annual extra hours balance* allows the employees or the RH manager to fix or set some of the previous attendances of the previous year, and after a few days or week the annual balance is updated with the latest modifications taken into account.


Usage
=====

As an employee, you continue to log your attendance as before with the base module hr_attendance. But you have now
new views to keep track of your extra hours evolution.

#. In **Attendances/Manage Attendances/Attendance days** you can view all your working days with the hours that
   were registered.
#. In **Attendances/Manage Attendances/Balance history** you can view your extra hours evolution
