                        <br />
                        Unfortunately, we are missing your sponsorship contribution for ${number} months = ${amount}
                        EUR. We would be
                        grateful if you could transfer the missing amount to Compassion:
                        <br />
                        IBAN: ${bank.acc_number}
                        <br />
                        BIC: ${bank.bank_id.bic}
                        <br />
                        and note your sponsor number ${partner.ref}.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If you do not have that possibility or if you have questions about the payments, please contact
                        us by replying to this email or calling us on +46 8 23 62 00, so we can find a solution together
                        for a regular
                        sponsorship support.
