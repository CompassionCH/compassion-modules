                    We very warmly thank you for your commitment to our sponsorship program and for supporting
                    ${firstname}.
                    However, we have not yet activated your ${'sponsorship' if len(children) == 1 else 'sponsorships'}
                    because we
                    haven't received your first payment yet.

                    % if not lsv_form_received:
                    We are still waiting for the banking authorization form. Please fill it and send it back to us so
                    that we can
                    begin the sponsorship.
                    % else:
                    The withdrawal from your account couldn't be executed. We therefore propose you to change your
                    payment mode and
                    payment mode and
                    settle a standing order with the reference that you can find on the attached payment slip.

                    % else:
                    It may have escaped your attention that the sponsorship is not yet paid in the amount of CHF
                    ${amount}.-
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We send you a payment slip so you can settle the payment <b>within ${extension} days</b>.
                    Please contact us if you are facing financial challenges. Together we will look for a solution which
                    guarantees
                    an ongoing support for ${children.get('your sponsored child')}.
                    If this letter has crossed with your payment, please accept our thanks and disregard this notice.
                    Thanks for
                    making the payment of your sponsorship a priority.
