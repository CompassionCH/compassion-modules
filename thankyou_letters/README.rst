Configuration
=============

By default, three donation configurations are set:

-  Small gifts (< 100CHF)
-  Standard gifts (100 - 999 CHF)
-  Large gifts (1000 CHF)

You can customize the limits by setting the three system parameters:

-  thankyou_letters.small
-  thankyou_letters.standard
-  thankyou_letters.large

One example template comes installed and is the same for the 3 donation
types. You can however create other ones and attach them in the
communication config (Sales -> Partner Communications -> Communication
Config)

In order to get a summary of the donations, activate the CRON sending it
and add a system parameter to set a User ID receiving the summary by
e-mail:

-  thankyou_letters.summary_user_id (1 for instance = admin)

You can as well edit the report layout for printing by changing the
report thankyou_letters.donation

Don't forget to create Success Stories to include them in your thank you
donations.
