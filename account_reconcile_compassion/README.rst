Reconcile rules with bvr_ref of invoice for Compassion CH.

This will add a Product field in the bank statement reconcile view that
will allow to create an invoice from a received payment. When choosing a
product, an invoice will be created and will be reconciled with the
given payment.

It finds a matching invoice for the move_line and reconciles only if the
amount of the payment corresponds or if it is a multiple of the invoice
amount. If many invoices are found, the first reconciled invoice is the
current invoice (last invoice that is not in future). Then it reconciles
the other invoices from last invoice to first.
