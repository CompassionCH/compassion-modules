                    Many projects are temporarily suspended in order for the Compassion staff to make some checkups. This is not a reason to worry.
                    Nevertheless we want to inform our sponsors, whenever there is a change about their donation. Transparency is very important to us.

                    It is up to you if you want to continue to pay or stop your payment, until we receive further information.
                    In case we donâ€™t hear anything from you, the money will go to the fund for unsponsored children.

                    <br/>
                    Please take note that if you are paying by LSV/Debit Direct we will continue the withdrawal and allocate it to the fund for unsponsored children.
                    If this is not your wish, please contact us as soon as possible.

                    Be assured, that our co-workers from Compassion will do their best to solve the problems in the project as quick as possible in order for the project to work in line with the Compassion standards.
