Account Statement Completion Rules for Compassion CH
=========================

- Add three completion methods :
    1. Completion method based on the BVR reference of the contract
       or the invoice.
    2. Completion method based on the reference of the partner
    3. Completion method for Raiffaisen statements (supplier invoices) based
       only on the amount.

- The first rule is applied. If no contract or invoice is found with same
  BVR reference, then second rule is applied, and an invoice is generated
  on-the-fly for gifts or funds donations.
- The third rule is useful only for supplier invoices.
